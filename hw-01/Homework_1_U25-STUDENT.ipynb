Move this notebook into that **new directory** in your repository then **add it and commit it to your repository**. **Important**: you'll want to make sure you **save and close** the notebook before you do this step and then re-open it once you've added it to your repository. **what git commands did you use to add and to commit? show the commands and commit message**.\n",
    "5. Finally, to test that everything is working, push the notebook file so that it shows up in your <font color=\"red\">**_private_**</font> GitHub repository on the web.**What command did you use?**\n",

    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"`cmse202-u25-turnin`\" repository inside the `hw-01` directory that you just created.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit.\n",
